# topX

While it will sort a text file full of ints,
It's utterly naive in every way.

## Usage

```bash
./topX <x> <file>
```

`topX` takes 2 arguments: `x` and `file`, where `x` is an integer, and `file` is
the path to a file full of integers, one per line, and prints the `x` largest
numbers in `file`, one per line.
